A practice website featuring a limited film catalogue without API.
Users can switch between dark & light mode and scroll through the lists of films.

The website is comsmetic only at this stage. Feeatures hover effects. No buttons are working.

This app is only for show and all its content are not owned by me.
Icons are fetched from fontawesome
